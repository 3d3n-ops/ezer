              Great question! &apos;Ezer&apos; is a Hebrew word for
              &apos;Helper&apos;. We chose this name because it closely relates
              to what Ezer will do for students, which is to help! That said,
              it&apos;s Hebrew pronunciation might be hard for everyday folk to
              pronounce, so we chose to pronounce it as &apos;ee-zer&apos;.
